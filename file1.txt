WEEK 5-6 Report by Wenxi Xie
During the fifth week, I created the REST API that allow user to modify the database using cURL comment. And after I received feedback from my manager and teammate, I optimized this function by adding in permission function, security filter and return result information. This function is eventually implemented in 2 features of the project and send to testing team for deployment test. The rest of the week, I am dealing with deployment documentation, demonstration of the functions to testing team, refine UAT and fixing bugs discovered. I also hangout with colleagues from SEEDers & SGUnited programme and had a half day off on Thursday due to Chinese New Year.
The first day of Sixth week is my off day because of Chinese New Year, on the second day, the company hold a virtual lunch meeting which allowed me to have lunch virtually with all my department colleagues. This is the first time I met all of them, we became familiar during the 3 hours virtual lunch session. The rest of the week, I was working on the stability and functional testing for deploying the program on all the server, optimizing the program structure and fix bugs gathered from UAT feedback including some buttons of the program not working, sever not responding, some timing function not working, granting permission to the testing teams etc. I also give hand to help my teammates fixing their raised issue while they are busy with higher priority task. By the end of the week, our team decide to deploy the program to user by the following week.
